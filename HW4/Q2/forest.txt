1.What is the main reason to use a random forest versus a decision tree? (<= 50 words)
Only using decision tree may cause overfitting. By applying random forest, we can choose train data randomly to train a more accurate model so that we will avoid large variance.

2.How long did your random forest take to run? (in seconds)
About 10 seconds

3.What accuracy (to two decimal places, xx.xx%) were you able to obtain?
About 72.90%
